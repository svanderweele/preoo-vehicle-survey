# Development Spec

## Tech Stack

### MongoDB

I chose MongoDB for Mongo Atlas as it provided the use of charts out of the box. This allowed me to compile the data requested using a UI. Would be useful for marketing or for clients to be able to compile charts themselves via the interface provided.

### NodeJS <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1110148780991623201/vlqCsAVP_400x400.png" width="20" title="hover text">

I used NodeJS as it has the ability to cluster instances and scale up very easily.
This way we use javascript on both the backend and frontend. Shifting between backend and frontend is easier then since we don't have to also worry about language.

### React <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/react-1-282599.png" width="20" title="hover text">

I chose React as it is lightweight and allows the freedom to set up the project as you wish.
